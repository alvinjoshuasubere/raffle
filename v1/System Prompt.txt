The excel will upload to the system with fields number, name, barangay, contact number fields then in the system you will only type the number and display the winner.I want database file and system using PHP. make the system with the background image only and add other effects for the animations and transitions but just make it simple the color palette is dark light brown with red, i want the upload, draw, prize and Winner to be navbar design and it has logo on the upper right. The uploading will be converted to csv. For the prize you will add prize name, upload image, quantity and type(Major and minor). First for drawing you will select a prize first then draw a number that will display in the modal the winner until the prize is all claimed by winners and disable the prize for it, on the modal add button if redraw number or if winner is around add button to remove quantity in the prizes, this is only for minors but major prizes the winner can be selected again but not twice in Minor but always add it in the winners tab to display winner with number, name , barangay, prize and type(Major or minor). For uploading in the CSV you can delete all uploaded and in the database its like a reset and upload again.. create me the code with css with database and the template for my excel.
